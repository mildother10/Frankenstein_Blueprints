       "# Code Review Decision\n",
       "\n",
       "## Final Decision\n",
       "**Request Changes**\n",
       "\n",
       "## Summary of Key Findings\n",
       "The code changes introduced in the pull request present several concerns that, while not critical, require attention to enhance security, maintainability, and overall code quality. The following minor issues were identified:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **SQL Injection Risk**: The code constructs raw SQL queries with direct user input, which poses a medium risk of SQL injection attacks. This can be mitigated by implementing parameterized queries or using an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library.\n",
       "- **Handling Date/Time in SQL**: Using `NOW()` directly in the SQL statement for updating the `last_login` timestamp may not work uniformly across different database systems. A better practice would be to handle date/time in Python or use compatible database functions.\n",
       "- **Logging for Security**: The current implementation of login attempts employs print statements, which is not secure. It is recommended to use a logging framework to manage logs correctly and securely.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Changes Required\n",
       "To align the code with best practices and eliminate vulnerabilities, please address the following:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **SQL Injection Prevention**: \n",
       "   - Modify the way user input is handled in SQL queries. Use parameterized queries or an ORM to prevent SQL injection.\n",
       "\n",
       "   Example:\n",
       "   ```python\n",
       "   user = db.query(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s\", (username,))\n",
       "   ```\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Date/Time Handling**:\n",
       "   - Refactor the `last_login` update logic to either use Python's datetime capabilities or compatible SQL functions rather than relying on `NOW()`.\n",
       "   \n",
       "   Example:\n",
       "   ```python\n",
       "   now = datetime.now()\n",
       "   db.execute(\"UPDATE users SET last_login = %s WHERE id = %s\", (now, user.id))\n",
       "   ```\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Logging Strategy**:\n",
       "   - Replace print statements with a structured logging framework that properly handles sensitive information.\n",
       "   \n",
       "   Example:\n",
       "   ```python\n",
       "   import logging\n",
       "   logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n",
       "   logger.info(f\"User {username} logged in successfully\")\n",
       "   logger.warning(f\"Failed login attempt for user {username}\")\n",
       "   ```\n",
       "\n",
       "## Additional Recommendations\n",
       "- Ensure that comprehensive unit tests cover these changes to validate that both authentication and logging work as expected without introducing additional vulnerabilities.\n",
       "- Consider performing a broader review of the entire user authentication process to maintain consistency and security across the application.\n",
       "\n",
       "By addressing these issues, the code will not only conform to security best practices but also enhance maintainability, ensuring a more robust application in future development cycles."
